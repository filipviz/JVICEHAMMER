# JVICEHAMMER

JVICEHAMMER is a Discord bot which monitors new members joining the JuiceboxDAO Discord server and checks their usernames and nicknames against a list of suspicious words and known contributor names. If a match is found, the user is muted for 24 hours, and a notification is sent to the operations channel.
